## New Game Mechanics

### Disguise

Creature cards with the disguise ability can be placed face down for any 3 mana as a 2/2 creature. They can be flipped right-side up at any point on either player's turn for the disguise cost listed on the card. Some disguise cards allow you to speed up your tempo by disguising and flipping cards that would normally cost a significant amount of mana. Other disguise cards trigger an ability when flipped over.

### Cloak

Cloak works pretty similar to disguise and you probably won't be encountering too many of these cards in your games. Cloak cards can be placed face down as a 2/2 and if it's a creature, it can be flipped up at any point equal to its mana cost.

### Suspect

Suspect cards can be good for higher tempo aggressive decks. This mechanic allows you to put a marker on a creature designating them as a suspect. Suspected creatures gain the menace ability at the cost of not being able to block damage.

### Collect Evidence

Collect evidence cards will ask you to exile cards from your graveyard with a combined mana cost of X (indicated on the collect evidence card).In return, you can use some strong abilities such as reducing the cost of cards, tapping enemy creatures, and more.
