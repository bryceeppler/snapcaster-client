## MTG Card Conditions

### Near Mint (NM)

![Thawing Glaciers (Near Mint)](/buyers-guide-images/mtg-collector-basics/thawing-near-mint.jpg)

Near Mint condition describes cards with minimal to no wear from general play. The edges, surfaces, and corners are in excellent condition but may have a tiny nick or flaw if it’s nearly imperceivable. Near Mint is the coined term for the best condition cards, not to be mistaken for the term “Mint”. Mint is normally not used since it’s extremely challenging to guarantee that a card is absolutely perfect.

### Lightly Played (LP)

![Lightning Bolt (Lightly Played)](/buyers-guide-images/mtg-collector-basics/lightning-lightly-played.jpg)

Lightly Played cards have slight imperfections that are slightly noticeable without affecting the card appearance unless inspected closely. Examples of wear include minor edge wear, tiny nicks, or very slight card face scuffs. These cards are still in good condition and imperfections are hardly noticeable when played in a sleeve.

### Moderately Played (MP)

![Counterspell (Moderately Played)](/buyers-guide-images/mtg-collector-basics/counterspell-moderatly-played.jpg)

Moderately Played cards show noticeable wear and are still legal for tournament play when sleeved. Signs of wear include moderate scratches, border wear, or creases that don’t affect the structural integrity of the card. These cards are a great option to get popular cards for a significantly lower price.

### Heavily Played (HP)

![Thawing Glaciers (Heavily Played)](/buyers-guide-images/mtg-collector-basics/thawing-heavily-played.jpg)

Heavily Played cards have major wear, including deep scratches, significant border wear, creases, fading, etc. Despite all the wear, these cards are in fact tournament legal if they are still easily identifiable and sleeved.

### Damaged (DMG)

![Ancestral Recall (Damaged)](/buyers-guide-images/mtg-collector-basics/ancestral-damaged.jpg)

Damaged cards have the most severe flaws and can affect their playability even if sleeved. Signs of a "Damaged" card include water damage, tears, holes, discoloration, damaged borders, and more. Cards in the Damaged condition are not legal for tournament play.

## Borders and Frames

### Full Art

![Plains 282 (MOM) - Full Art](/buyers-guide-images/mtg-collector-basics/plains-full-art.jpg)

Full art cards feature artwork that covers the entire card face with minimal borders. This is commonly found in lands, but they can also appear on other cards.

### Extended Art

![Baru, Wurmspeaker (DMC) - Extended Art](/buyers-guide-images/mtg-collector-basics/baru-extended.jpg)

Extended Art cards extend the artwork to the edges of the card, reducing the border size. Unlike borderless cards, they don't eliminate the card's border.

### Borderless

![Azami, Lady of Scrolls (CMM) - Borderless](/buyers-guide-images/mtg-collector-basics/azami-borderless.jpg)

Borderless cards feature art extending to the edges of the card with no border remaining, except at the bottom for the artist's name and set symbol. Alternate art cards are often borderless, but this style can also be found in other categories like Showcase cards.

### Showcase

![Olivia, Crimson Bride (VOW) - Fang Frame Showcase](/buyers-guide-images/mtg-collector-basics/olivia-fang-frame.jpg)

Showcase cards were introduced with the release of Throne of Eldraine in October 2019. They offer an alternate treatment unique to each set. Showcase frames include styles like the Fang frame, Storybook frame, and Retro frame.

### Black Border

![Cryptex (MKM) - Black Border](/buyers-guide-images/mtg-collector-basics/cryptex-black-border.jpg)

Black-bordered cards feature a black outline. Originally used for new cards, it has been the standard since Tenth Edition, including reprints. Foreign-language black-bordered cards from Revised and Fourth Edition distinguish new-language versions.

### White Border

![Shock (8ED) - White Border](/buyers-guide-images/mtg-collector-basics/shock-white-border.jpg)

White-bordered cards were printed between Unlimited and Ninth Edition but are no longer being produced.

### Gold Border

![Gaea's Cradle (WC99) - Gold Border](/buyers-guide-images/mtg-collector-basics/gaeas-gold-border.jpg)

Gold-bordered cards feature a gold outline, commonly used in commemorative sets. They are found in Collectors Edition, tournament decks (1997-2004), and the 30th Anniversary Edition. These cards aren't tournament-legal due to their distinct backs.

### Silver Border

![Do-It-Yourself Seraph (UST) - Silver Border](/buyers-guide-images/mtg-collector-basics/seraph-silver-border.jpg)

Silver-bordered cards are non-legal, with a silver outline. They come from parody sets like Unglued, promos, and holiday cards. Their mechanics aren't compatible with standard formats.

## Types of Foils

### Pre-Modern Foil

Pre-Modern Foil cards were the first foil cards printed, dating back to the Urza’s Legacy set in 1999 up until the Eighth Edition in 2003. They include a shooting star in the bottom left corner and represent an exclusive subset of cards before the modern format was introduced. These cards had a known printing issue where a print line seam would appear on the card face.

### Traditional Foil

## Promos, Promo Pack, and Pre-release cards

### Promo Cards

Promo cards have a bit of a vague meaning in MTG. They can simply have different art or have a stamp on them and are usually handed out at an event or tournament. A promo card doesn't necessarily mean that it's a promo pack or pre-release card but often times is.

### Pre-release Cards

![Vannifar, Evolved Enigma Pre-release (PMKM)](/buyers-guide-images/mtg-collector-basics/vannifar-prerelease.jpg)

Pre-release cards are given to players who attend pre-release events leading up to a new set. These events are typically held at official local game stores across the country prior to the set’s official launch. These cards are meant to provide players with a sneak peek of the new set, typically a week before the release. They are often creatures that highlight a new aspect of the set, featuring a unique stamp not found on regular cards.

### Promo Pack

![Vannifar, Evolved Enigma Promo (PMKM)](/buyers-guide-images/mtg-collector-basics/vannifar-promo.jpg)

Promo Pack cards fall into a broader category and are not synonymous with pre-release events or cards. These cards can be obtained through various means including buy-a-box promos, special products, promotional packs, and more. This category of cards includes a wide range of cards from local game store giveaways and tournament rewards. They may feature unique elements like alternate arts and foil treatments that are absent from their regular set's printings.
