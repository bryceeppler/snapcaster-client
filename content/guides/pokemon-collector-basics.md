## Starting Your Collection

Starting a Pokémon TCG collection can be as simple as choosing the specific Pokémon you like or focusing on completing a set or theme. Collectors usually start by buying theme decks or booster boxes from a new series and then gradually trade or purchase specific cards to complete their collection.

## Pokémon TCG Card Basics

Pokémon cards are categorized into 3 types of cards:

- Pokémon Cards: These are the main cards used in the TCG used to battle opponents. Pokémon cards will have information about the Pokémon’s type, health points, abilities, and collector number printed on the card.
- Trainer Cards: These cards are categorized into Items, Supporters and Stadiums, each with their own specific use cases. They provide supportive actions on your turn that can alter gameplay, such as healing Pokémon or forcing your opponent to discard a card.
- Energy Cards: Energy cards are used in conjunction with your Pokémon cards and are necessary to execute your Pokémon’s attacks on your turn.

## Pokémon TCG Card Basics

When shopping for booster packs, you’ll encounter several product types:

- Booster Packs: These contain a random assortment of typically 10 cards, usually with a mixture of rarities.
- Booster Boxes: A box typically contains 36 booster packs and offers a bulk option often at a better per-pack price than buying individually.
- Theme Decks: Pre-constructed decks designed to be played out of the box, great for beginners.
- Elite Trainer Boxes: These premium boxes contain 9 booster packs and typically contain unique collectables exclusive to the ETB. These collectables include booster packs, energy cards, dice, card sleeves, etc.

## Pull Rates when Unpacking Cards

When getting into unpacking booster packs or boxes, it’s very important that you understand the pull rates since it’s usually more cost effective to just buy your cards as singles then opening packs. The pull rate is the probability of unpacking rare cards from a booster pack.

- Distribution of Rarity: Each booster pack usually includes one rare card, which could be a Rare, Ultra Rare, or even a Secret Rare card. Generally, a booster box (36 packs) will contain around 5 Ultra Rare cards and one Secret Rare if you’re lucky but can vary significantly depending on what set you’re opening.
- Booster Boxes and Booster Packs: Buying a booster box rather than individual packs can be a little more cost effective and provide a more predictable distribution of rare cards. Booster boxes by design contain a set number of higher-rarity cards which make them the ideal choice for unpacking chase cards. Individual booster packs purchased have a higher chance of variability and can differ if they are from batches.
- Special Products: Products like Elite Trainer Boxes or special premium collections contain booster packs and can have different pull rates depending on compared to regular booster boxes. The big selling point with these special products is that they usually include unique items or cards exclusive to the Special product/bundle.
- Set Size and Card Distribution: The size of the Pokémon TCG set also affects pull rates. Larger sets with more rare cards can reduce the chances of pulling any specific rare card. Smaller sets on the other hand might increase the chances of getting specific cards at the expense of lowering the diversity of the cards you pull.

Understanding pull rates will help with your purchasing strategy and set realistic expectations for what you might unpack. 9 times out of 10 It will always be better to purchase the specific cards you are looking for rather than unpacking them. From a collector’s standpoint, boxes retain their value unopened and drop significantly when unpacked because of the low return on investment on the individual cards.

## Card Rarity

Pokémon cards come in a variety of rarities which drastically affect their market value and collectability.

- Common (Black Circle), Uncommon (Black Diamond), Rare (Black Star): Booster packs will typically have 4 common, 3 uncommon, 3 foils with at least one of these cards being a rare of higher.
- Ultra Rare: Ultra Rare cards include EX, GX, V, VMAX, Full Art cards which are much harder to find and have unique designs.
- Secret Rare: Secret Rare cards are extremely limited cards and usually include unique and shiny foiling effects. These cards are numbered higher than the official set count at the bottom of the card.

We hope this article has helped you understand the basics of purchasing Pokémon TCG whether you plan on playing competitively or just want to start your personal collection. You can expect Pokémon to be added to Snapcaster soon.
