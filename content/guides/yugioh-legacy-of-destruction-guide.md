## Tenpai Dragon

The Tenpai Dragon archetype takes center stage in this set. These fiery dragons emphasize quick-effect Synchro Summoning and offer impressive consistency. With 1-card starters like Sangen Summoning, Sangen Kaimen, and Tenpai Chundra, Tenpai dragons can unleash devastating combos that result in OTKs.

## Yubel

This beloved archetype from the show gets more new support in this set. With the support the deck received in Phantom Nightmare, this deck strategy can now thrive in today's strong combo heavy meta. Nightmare Throne is the brand new field spell that gives the deck their own ROTA white also giving the deck a way to summon Yubel for free.

## Melodious

With the new wave of support for the melodious archetype, the deck can now thrive in today's meta. The deck is capable of combo-ing hard and outputting big boards that are hard to break. You are now able to set up 2 new end board monsters: Flowering Etoile the Melodious Magnificat and Bacha the Melodious Maestra. These 2 combined together allows for an interruption that can send cards back to the opponent's hand while the other stops Melodious monsters effect to be negated making it very difficult to play around.

## Lightsworn

An oldie but a goodie. This mill heavy archetype allows for a freestyle combo deck that feels so rewarding to pilot if done properly. Lightsworn has seen meta relevance many times as it creeps in and out of metas every few years with new waves of support. In LEDE it gets some amazing cards that help deal with some of the weak points the deck can have. Weiss, Lightsworn Archfiend now fixes those dead bricks in your hand by allowing you to put back Wulf or Felis on top of your deck to then special summon the card. Once summoned you can now mill 2, getting those graveyard effects to go off.

## Snake-Eyes

The deck of the format. This archetype has been at the top of the metagame for many sets and is clearly the go to deck if you’d like to do well in the format. Already being the best deck in the format you’d think they didn’t need anymore support Konami decided to give the deck even more. Snake-Eyes Diabellstar gives you access to removal while also allowing itself to be recycled.

## Ragnaraika

The heart of the Ragnaraika theme lies in its natural resource loop. All three main deck monsters share an effect: they can Special Summon themselves by discarding, banishing, or returning another Plant, Insect, or Reptile monster to the bottom of the deck. This ability allows for explosive Link Climb plays, progressively summoning stronger Link Monsters.

The archetype boasts impressive Link Monsters, including the LINK-4 “Ragnaraika Chain Coils”, which prevents both players from using hand effects for the turn, and the formidable LINK-5 “Ragnaraika Stag Sovereign”, capable of destroying any two monsters on the field when the opponent Special Summons from the Main Deck or Extra Deck.

## Shining Sarcophagus

Shining Sarcophagus takes center stage in this theme, based on Yugi’s winning card from his final duel with Atem: Gold Sarcophagus. This card allows for you to empower multiple new cards and try to summon Gandora-G the Dragon of Destruction. You are also able to use the newly revamped Silent Magician cards that allow you to create interruptions on your opponent's turn while also gaining advantage. On top of that you can utilize the new Moremarshmallon which creates a dilemma for your opponent as they must attack it but if you control a shining sarcophagus they cannot destroy it by battle.

## Special mentions

Alongside these archetypes many more got great new support such as: Ancient Gear, Centur-Ion, Vaalmonica, Gold Pride, Goblin and more.

Whether you’re a seasoned Duelist or just starting your journey, Legacy of Destruction offers fresh strategies, nostalgic nods, and thrilling gameplay. So, grab your cards, build your deck, and leave your mark in the annals of Dueling history!
