With the release of Snapcasters Yugioh service, we wanted to provide you with all the information you need when it comes to Yugioh card collection. This guide explains all of the basics including the different types of cards, rarities, foil types, details about the types of sealed products alongside the typical pull rates for each one.

## Starting Your Collection

Just like any other TCG, we recommend that you avoid unpacking booster packs and boxes if you’re trying to collect a specific card or rare cards across several different sets. If you’re looking to complete the entire set of a new collection, then you can get a booster box to get started.

## Card Rarities and Foiling

Yugioh’s pull rate is based on a subset of possible rarities that you can open in a booster pack. Each of these types feature a different combination of holographic and styling depending on the rarity level of the card. The possible rarity options in Yugioh are as follows:

- Common cards are the most basic rarity type and come with no special art, foiling, or designs.
- Rare cards feature holo silver lettering on the card face.
- Super Rare cards feature regular lettering on the card face but holographic artwork.
- Ultra Rare cards use holographic gold lettering and artwork on the card face.
- Secret Rare cards have a special variation of holographic patters on the card face and include rainbow coloured lettering.
- Prismatic Secret Rare cards feature a unique prismatic foil pattern on the artwork, giving them a distinct and eye-catching appearance.
- Ultimate Rares feature multi leveled textured art on the card face.
- Ghost Rares use a unique white 3 dimensional holographic card art
- Secret Rares use an exclusive shiny diamond like foiling on the card art.

## Types of Products

There are 3 main types of sealed products you should be looking out for at your local TCGs:

- Booster packs are the lowest barrier of entry for collecting Yugioh and will contain a random assortment of 9 cards. The pull rates on average in a booster pack contains 1 guaranteed rare card. The odds of pulling a Super Rare or higher rarity card in an individual booster is 1 in every 4 packs.
- Standard Booster boxes contain 24 booster packs. They offer more value per pack and can offer a more predictable distribution of rarities. You can usually expect to find roughly 5 Super Rare cards and 1-2 Ultra Rare cards in a single booster box.
- Special edition boxes typically contain a handful of packs and an exclusive promotional card that can’t be unpacked in boosters. The pull rates for the booster packs from a special edition box are the same as any other regular booster packs.
