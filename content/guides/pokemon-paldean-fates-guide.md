The Pokémon Scarlet & Violet Paldean Fates launched on January 26 2024. The big theme in this expansion is the 100+ shiny Pokémon printings and the higher than usual amount of secret rares. This set introduces 91 cards in its main set and a staggering 154 secret rare cards. Every single secret rare Pokémon will be printed in their shiny forms.

## Notable New Cards

### Charizard ex 234/091

To nobody's surprise, Tera Charizard ex is the most desirable and expensive card in Paldean Fates. On top of being a historically expensive card, this Charizard card is used in the most popular meta standard decks. If you're lucky enough to pull one of these, you can expect to sell it for almost 200 dollars in good condition.

### Mew ex 232/091

This unique shiny mew was drawn by Usgmen, a popular artist known for his unique and cute sketches. Although this card probably won't be in any competitive decks, Mew ex is the second most valuable card in this set thanks to its unique art, shiny form, and rarity due to the sheer amount of secret rares in this set.

### Pikachu 131/091

Although pikachu is a heavily printed card, I'm putting the secret rare pikachu on the list because of how well it's been retaining value on the market in the past couple months since release. Since writing this article, Pikachu 131 is one of the few cards in this set that hasn't depreciated in value and has actually doubled in market price since launch. Despite not being a full art card, pikachu is still the fan favourite Pokémon behind Charizard. With all the secret rares in this set, pulling this secret rare Pikachu will be even more difficult than usual.

## Sealed Products

### Temporal Forces Booster Bundle

Paldean Fates is a special set meaning that there are no English booster boxes. Alternatively, you can get the booster bundle if you want to get the most bang for your buck per pack. You can still buy these from local game stores for 35-40 per bundle. These bundles come with 6 packs which comes out to 6 dollars per pack.

### Elite Trainer Box Paldean Fates

The standard elite trainer box comes with 9 packs for about 60, coming out to about 6.5 dollars per pack. Although it's not as cost effective as a booster bundle, this ETB comes with accessories including unique dice, coins, Iron Leaves card sleeves, markers, and a promo card of Shiny Mimikyu exclusive to this box. If you really want the promotional card or need it to complete your set, you should limit yourself to just buying one of these boxes. The Pokémon Center also sells a more limited exclusive ETB which comes with a second Mimikyu promo that comes with a stamp on the card face.

### Premium Collection Paledean Fates

There are 3 sets of Premium Collection boxes for each of the Scarlet and Violet starter Pokémon, each containing their own set of 3 unique promo cards. These boxes cost about 55 dollars and come with 8 booster packs which comes out to 6.9 dollars per pack.

### Paldean Fates Tins

There are 3 sets of Premium Collection boxes for each of the Scarlet and Violet starter Pokémon, each containing their own set of 3 unique promo cards. These boxes cost about 55 dollars and come with 8 booster packs which comes out to 6.9 dollars per pack. These tins still go for about 35-40 depending on your local game store with the exception of that after market tax on the Charizard tin.

### Paldean Fates Mini Tins

Mini tins in this set contain 2 booster packs and a sticker sheet, and an exclusive art card which you can still purchase for about 15 dollars per tin. There are 5 variations of these mini tins featuring Flamigo, Tinkatink, Finizen, Smoliv, and Maushold.

### Paldean Fates Sticker Collection

The sticker collection comes with 3 booster packs, a unique sticker, and a shiny promo card. The three sticker packs available feature Fidough, Maschiff, and Greavard.

This set is a really exciting addition thanks to the insane amount of secret rares in this collection. This will probably be one of the more difficult sets to complete by unpacking it yourself but you can take advantage of our Pokémon Single Search tool to complete your set collection!
