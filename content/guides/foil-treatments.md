## Pre-Modern Foil

Pre-Modern Foil cards were the first foil cards printed, dating back to the Urza’s Legacy set in 1999 up until the Eighth Edition in 2003. They include a shooting star in the bottom left corner and represent an exclusive subset of cards before the modern format was introduced. These cards had a known printing issue where a print line seam would appear on the card face.

## Traditional Foil
