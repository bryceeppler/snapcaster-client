The One Piece trading card game has become extremely popular this past year. More and more tournaments have been reserving space for One Piece and are easily selling out tickets. We hope this article can be useful for anyone looking to get started in this TCG. This article will give you the basics on how to start your collection, the card types, card rarities, foil types, sealed products, and pull rates.

## Starting Your Collection

If you’re a complete beginner, we recommend purchasing one of the pre constructed starter decks from your local game store. These starter decks can even contain exclusive cards that can’t be unpacked in regular booster packs.

## Card Types

There are 5 types of cards you need to familiarize yourself with:

### Leader Cards

Each player will have 1 leader card which determines the colour cards you can use in your deck. They can have one or more colour. Leader cards have different health values, power levels, and unique win conditions.

### Don Cards

Don cards are resources used to play character cards and activate various abilities. If you’re not using the Don card for an effect, you can add it to a character or leader to give them an additional 1000 power for each card attached.

### Character Cards

These are the main cards used to attack and defend against your opponent. Character cards will have a cost to play it, attack power, defense power, and various special abilities. Your character cards must match the colours indicated on your leader card.

### Event Cards

Event cards are the equivalent to spells in other TCG’s. Event cards come in the 6 standard colours and must match your leader card. Just like character cards, event cards also need to be played with Don cards equal to their cost.

### Stage Cards

Stage cards are played from your hand next to your leader. Stage cards will activate its effect on specific moments during a turn (On play, during main phase, and end of turn).

## Card Rarities

One Piece cards come in 5 card rarities: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Super Rare, Secret Rare.

## Foil Types

Foil cards are special versions of regular cards that have unique reflective material on the card face. Rare cards and above will typically be foiled and can come in different variations such as regular foil or even a gold foil.

## Sealed products

Collectors have several options when it comes to purchasing One Piece TCG products, each offering different types of cards and opportunities for rare finds:

### Booster Packs

One piece booster packs will typically contain 10 cards, one of which is guaranteed to be rare or higher.

### Starter Decks

Starter decks are preconstructed decks you can pre buy from your local game stores. Some local game stores sell these decks in sets of 4 so you can try out different coloured decks.

### Booster Boxes

Booster boxes contain 24 packs and are the most cost effective way to unpack cards. The price per pack is quite higher than other TCG’s since purchasing options in Canada are pretty limited.

## Pull Rates

### Booster Pack Rates

These packs usually contain one rare card with super rares or better appearing in roughly 1 out of every 5 packs.

### Booster Boxe Rates

The card distribution in a booster box can vary but you will usually unpack at least one secret rare card and about 5 super rare cards.

One Piece has become a high demand competitive TCG this past year and we hope we can help help grow the Canadian community by launching our One Piece module later this month. Depending on the popularity, we can look into developing premium features in the future.
