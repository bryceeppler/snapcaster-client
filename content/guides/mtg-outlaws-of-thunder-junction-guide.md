### Committing a Crime

Many cards in OTJ have an affect when you successfully commit a crime. To commit a crime, you must either trigger/activate an ability or spell on top of the stack where it targets either an opponent, spell/ability controlled by the opponent, a permanent the opponent controls, or a card in the opponent’s graveyard.
The crime occurs regardless of what happens after you cast your ability/spell. Examples of successful crime triggers include summoning token creatures on your board or viewing the top cards of your deck.

### Spree

Spree is a new keyword found on several instant and sorceries cards in this set. A player can choose up as many additional modes (modifiers) listed under the spree keyword and pay the additional mana cost associated with the modes you select. One important note is that you can’t use the same mode multiple times on the same cast. You must choose one or more modes as you cast a spell with spree.

### Mounts and Saddle

Mounts are just a new creature type where you’ll typically find the saddle ability. Saddle is a sorcery activated ability that you do during your main phase. To activate, the number of untapped creatures on your board equal to the number associated with the saddle keyword.
As the saddle ability resolves, mounts become saddled until end of turn and typically involve an attack trigger only while saddled.

### Plot

Plot is a new mechanic where you pay a cost up front and exile a card in your hand which then becomes plotted. In return, you can cast a plotted card from exile without paying its mana cost on a subsequent turn. This is a great way to stay on tempo and setup for a bigger play in a future turn. The only restrictions are that you can’t cast your exiled card the same turn it was plotted and that it acts as a sorcery.
