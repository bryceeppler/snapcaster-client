## Pre-release Cards

Pre-release cards are given to players who attend pre-release events leading up to a new set. These events are typically held at official local game stores across the country prior to the setâ€™s official launch. These cards are meant to provide players with a sneak peek of the new set, typically a week before the release. They are often creatures that highlight a new aspect of the set, featuring a unique stamp not found on regular cards.

## Promo Cards

Promo cards fall into a broader category and are not synonymous with pre-release events or cards. These cards can be obtained through various means including buy-a-box promos, special products, promotional packs, and more. This category of cards includes a wide range of cards from local game store giveaways and tournament rewards. They may feature unique elements like alternate arts and foil treatments that are absent from their regular set's printings.
