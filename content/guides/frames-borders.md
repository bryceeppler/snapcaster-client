## Full Art

![Plains 282 (MOM) - Full Art](/buyers-guide-images/plains-full-art.jpg)

Full art cards feature artwork that covers the entire card face with minimal borders. This is commonly found in lands, but they can also appear on other cards.

## Extended Art

Extended Art cards extend the artwork to the edges of the card, reducing the border size. Unlike borderless cards, they don't eliminate the card's border.

## Borderless

![Azami, Lady of Scrolls (CMM) - Borderless](/buyers-guide-images/azami-borderless.jpg)

Borderless cards feature art extending to the edges of the card with no border remaining, except at the bottom for the artist's name and set symbol. Alternate art cards are often borderless, but this style can also be found in other categories like Showcase cards.

## Showcase

Showcase cards were introduced with the release of Throne of Eldraine in October 2019. They offer an alternate treatment unique to each set. Showcase frames include styles like the Fang frame, Storybook frame, and Retro frame.

## Black Border

Black-bordered cards feature a black outline. Originally used for new cards, it has been the standard since Tenth Edition, including reprints. Foreign-language black-bordered cards from Revised and Fourth Edition distinguish new-language versions.

## White Border

White-bordered cards were printed between Unlimited and Ninth Edition but are no longer being produced.

## Gold Border

![Gaea's Cradle (WC99) - Gold Border](/buyers-guide-images/gaeas-gold-border.jpg)

Gold-bordered cards feature a gold outline, commonly used in commemorative sets. They are found in Collectors Edition, tournament decks (1997-2004), and the 30th Anniversary Edition. These cards aren't tournament-legal due to their distinct backs.

## Silver Border

![Do-It-Yourself Seraph (UST) - Silver Border](/buyers-guide-images/seraph-silver-border.jpg)

Silver-bordered cards are non-legal, with a silver outline. They come from parody sets like Unglued, promos, and holiday cards. Their mechanics aren't compatible with standard formats.

## Art Series

![Asari Captain (ANEO) - Art Series](/buyers-guide-images/asari-art-series.jpg)

Art Series cards debuted in the Modern Horizons Art Series (June 2019) and are oriented horizontally. They feature full-edge artwork without borders or text. The Signature variant includes the artist's signature on the front.
