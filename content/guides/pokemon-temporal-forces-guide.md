The latest set Pokémon Scarlet & Violet Temporal Forces launched on March 22 2024, introducing 162 cards in its main set alongside 56 secret rare cards. This expansion is a bit smaller than what we're used to, but it reintroduces some powerful cards and a nice variety of collectable cards.

## Notable New Cards

### Iron Crown ex 206/162

Iron Crown ex is one of the most secret rare cards you can unpack from this new set. Its ability Cobalt Command is great for setting up future plays by adding 20 damage to an opponent's Pokémon caused by attacks from your future Pokémon.

### Walking Wake ex 205/162

One of the three generation 2 legendary Pokémon Suicune comes in its paradox form Walking Wake ex this set. Although not as competitive compared to his other 2 counterparts, the stunning artwork on this card makes it a must for completing your set collection.

### Gouging Fire ex 204/162

Gouging Fire, the paradox form of Entei is the second most desirable legendary beast in this set. Blaze Blitz is good for knocking out most Pokémon in one attack at a staggering 260 damage.

### Raging Bolt ex 208/162

The most desirable legendary beast card is Raging Bolt ex, the paradox form of Raikou. Bellowing Thunder is a great way to knock out premiere meta Pokémon in one attack.

## Game Mechanics

### Ace Spec Prime Catcher 157/162

A new set of Ace Spec cards are being printed in Temporal Forces. These cards are extremely powerful trainer cards and are limited to 1 per deck. One of the most valuable Ace Spec cards in this set is the Prime Catcher which forces both players to swap their active Pokémon with a benched Pokémon.

### Ace Spec Maximum Belt 154/162

Another notable Ace Spec card is Maximum Belt. Although not as versatile as Prime Catcher, the fact that it applies 50 additional damage to ex Pokémon makes a lot of Pokémon more viable allowing them to knock out meta cards like Charizard EX.

## Sealed Products

### Booster Box

The Temporal Forces Booster Box contains 36 booster packs which will set you back about 150 at most local game stores. This is going to give you the most bang for your buck at about 4 dollars per booster pack. Unlike other TCG's the cards unpacked from a booster box is no different from any other booster packs. This is the go to option if you don't care about the exclusive accessories and card in the Elite Trainer Box.

### Elite Trainer Box Iron Leaves

The non Pokémon center store elite trainer box Iron Leaves comes with 9 packs for about 55, coming out to about 6 dollars per pack. Of course you get your standard accessories including unique dice, coins, Iron Leaves card sleeves, markers, and a promo card of Iron Thorns exclusive to this box.

### Elite Trainer Box Walking Wake

Just like the Walking Wake elite trainer box, Walking Wake comes with 9 packs for about 55 coming out to about 6 dollars per pack. The accessories included in this box set includes unique dice, coins, Walking Wake card sleeves, markers, and a promo card of Flutter Mane exclusive to this box.

### Temporal Forces Booster Bundle

The little brother of the booster box, the booster bundle is a great way of purchasing packs if you don't want to spend 150 on 36 packs from this set. These boxes contain 6 booster packs typically go for 30 dollars which comes out to about 5 dollars per pack.

### 3 Pack Blister

These come with 3 booster packs and one exclusive promotional card containing either Cleffa or Cyclizar. These are going for about 17 dollars which comes out to around 5.6 dollars per pack. If you enjoy Cleffa Cyclizar then you should pick up one but you're better off getting the booster bundle or booster box if you want to get the most out of your money.

### Single Pack Blister

Similar to the 3 pack blister, the single pack blister comes with 1 booster pack, their own exclusive promo card and coins. The 2 promo cards are Bellibolt and Carvanha. I generally would stay away from these since they sell for 7 dollars a pack at most local game stores in return for a lackluster promotional card and coin.
