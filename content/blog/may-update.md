This last month started off pretty slow, I was finishing up some exams and didn't have a ton of time for developing new features. However, the time off gave us some time to think about the direction we are heading with Snapcaster!

## May Updates

Snapcaster has received great support from the community, and we enjoy building cool things to help people find good deals for building their decks. We have been experimenting with some new features, and thinking about what direction to take them in. Recently we decided to make a slight pivot, steering away from MTG specific tools, into more generic implementations of our service for multiple TCGs.

## Features

### New TCGs

Coming soon, we will be expanding Snapcaster to several new TCGs. To start, only the single search feature will be available while we hash out some details, but you can expect to see most existing features available across all TCGs at some point in the future. These new modules will only support about 47 local game stores compared to the 70 that our Magic the Gathering module uses.

### Pokemon

Pokémon was the first TCG we wanted to add to Snapcaster after spending some time on our Magic the Gathering Modules. The amount of people that collect and play Pokémon TCG is huge. We hope that our Pokémon collectors can save some money completing their decks and set collections.

### Yugioh

The last of the big 3 TCG's has finally been added to Snapcaster. We're thinking of adding Yugioh as an advanced search module since one of our developers is an expert in this TCG but it can be a bit messy with all the different card variations and naming conventions.

### Lorcana

We're going to be experimenting with Lorcana this month in our single search module. Some of the cards go for pretty high prices and lots of Disney enthusiasts love collecting these. The combat gameplay is relatively simple and fun so we will closely monitor its use in the meantime.

### One Piece

The One Piece card game has been extremely successful since it's launch. This past month they held their biggest North American competitive tournament in Canada with great success. From a collector’s standpoint these cards can go for pretty high prices, and we've noticed this demand. That's why we're happy to be adding the One Piece TCG to Snapcaster single search later this month.

### Wishlists & Multisearch

It's no secret that wishlists haven't been as useful as we were hoping. After some tinkering, I've gained some clarity on how we can repurpose them to have a bit more utility for our premium users. We've heard your requests for cart optimization, preferred stores and some other features and have come up with some ideas that should meet some of these requests. There is some overlap in the functionality of wishlists and multisearch features, so we plan to merge the two into a more useful implementation.

Wishlists will be temporarily disabled for now as we look to integrate the best features of multisearch and wishlists into one tool.

### UI

If you've been using Snapcaster for a while you'll see slight UI changes on almost every page. The search bar and autocomplete service is more responsive and was added to the Advanced Search page. Filter dropdowns with excessive amounts of options have a search bar built into it that will filter your options based on what you typed.

We've been talking to a handful of local game stores and are all excited work together to promote Canadian stores. Some of these stores such as Carta Magica Ottawa, Carta Magica Montreal, and Red Dragon have given us discount codes on your purchase of Singles. You'll notice in Advanced Search that we will apply the 5% promo code automatically in the query results alongside a badge containing the promo code you need to apply at checkout. You can expect to see this applied automatically in single search in the coming days. You can find these promo codes in our official Discord.

### Bug Fixes

- General UI updates and fixes
- Fixed broken buttons

During the first half of the upcoming month, we’ll be focusing on bugs and UX enhancements from our to-do list, as well as adding Pokémon, Yugioh, Lorcana, and One Piece to our single search. Thank you for your support!
