This last month started off pretty slow, I was finishing up some exams and didn't have a ton of time for developing new features. However, the time off gave us some time to think about the direction we are heading with Snapcaster!

## May Updates

Snapcaster has received great support from the community and we enjoy building cool things to help people find good deals for building their decks. We have been experimenting with some new features, and thinking about what direction to take them in. Recently we decided to make a slight pivot, steering away from MTG specific tools, into more generic implementations of our service for multiple TCGs.

## Features

### New TCGs

Coming soon, we will be expanding Snapcaster to several new TCGs, beginning with Pokemon, moving onto Yugioh and potentially Lorcana. To start, only the single search feature will be available while we hash out some details, but you can expect to see most existing features available across all TCGs at some point in the future.

### Wishlists & Multisearch

It's no secret that wishlists haven't been as useful as we were hoping. After some tinkering, I've gained some clarity on how we can repurpose them to have a bit more utility for our premium users. We've heard your requests for cart optimization, preferred stores and some other features and have come up with some ideas that should meet some of these requests. There is some overlap in the functionality of wishlists and multisearch features, so we plan to merge the two into a more useful implementation.

### Bug Fixes

- General UI updates and fixes.

During the first half of the upcoming month, weâ€™ll be focusing on bugs and UX enhancements from our to-do list, as well as adding Pokemon to our single search. Thank you for your support!
