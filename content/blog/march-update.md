This month has been a significant one for Snapcaster! I've optimized the backend infrastructure, which has greatly improved both reliability and performance for searches. With these enhancements out of the way, we can now focus on developing new features. Additionally, we've introduced the Snapcaster Pro membership, providing an avenue for users to support the development and maintenance of Snapcaster.

We have also launched our Discord server, where you can join to give us feedback, report bugs, and keep up with updates. We're excited to have you join our community and look forward to hearing your thoughts and suggestions.

Moving forward, new features will primarily be exclusive to Pro members. We've already begun implementing some of these features, and users can anticipate seeing them evolve over time. Note that we intend on keeping the core search and multisearch functionality free.

## New Features

### Wishlists

- Users can now create lists of cards for easy price checking.
- A price notification feature is in the works, which will allow users to be notified when a card matching their criteria becomes available.

### Advanced Search

- An advanced search feature now supports the majority of stores on Snapcaster.
- Efforts are ongoing to expand this feature to include as many websites on Snapcaster as possible.
- This tool enables users to filter by specific criteria, helping to exclude unwanted cards or discover deals on specific printings or art styles.
