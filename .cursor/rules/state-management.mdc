# State Management Guidelines

## Zustand
- Create separate stores for different domains
- Keep store logic simple and focused
- Implement proper typing for store state and actions
- Use selectors to access specific parts of state

## React Query
- Use for server state management
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Handle loading and error states
- Use query invalidation appropriately

## Local State
- Use useState for simple component state
- Use useReducer for complex state logic
- Keep state as close as possible to where it's used
- Avoid unnecessary state

## Context
- Use for deeply nested component trees
- Keep context providers focused on specific domains
- Implement proper memoization for context values
- Avoid putting too much in a single context

## State Updates
- Use immutable update patterns
- Batch related state updates
- Avoid direct mutation of state
- Implement optimistic updates for better UX
