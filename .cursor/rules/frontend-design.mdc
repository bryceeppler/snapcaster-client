# Frontend Design Rules

## Component Structure
- Components should follow the single responsibility principle
- Break down complex UI into smaller, reusable components
- Use composition over inheritance for component relationships

## Styling
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Extract common patterns into custom Tailwind components using `@layer components`
- Use CSS variables for theming and dynamic values
- Follow mobile-first responsive design principles

## Accessibility
- All interactive elements must have appropriate ARIA attributes
- Implement keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Use semantic HTML elements whenever possible

## Performance
- Implement code-splitting for large components
- Lazy load images and heavy components
- Optimize render performance by memoizing expensive components
- Minimize unnecessary re-renders

## Design System
- Follow the established design system for consistency
- Use the defined color palette from the theme
- Maintain consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- Use the defined typography scale for font sizes
- We use ShadCN for our component library
