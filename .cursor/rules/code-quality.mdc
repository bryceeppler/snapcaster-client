# Code Quality Standards

## TypeScript
- Use proper TypeScript types for all variables, functions, and components
- Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Create interfaces or types for complex data structures
- Use union types for variables that can have multiple types

## Functions
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task
- Use descriptive function names that indicate what they do
- Implement proper error handling in functions
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations

## Variables
- Use descriptive variable names
- Prefer const over let when variables don't need to be reassigned
- Avoid global variables
- Use proper scoping for variables

## Comments
- Write comments for complex logic
- Document public APIs and components
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and components
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries for React components
- Use try/catch for error-prone operations
- Log errors appropriately
- Provide user-friendly error messages
